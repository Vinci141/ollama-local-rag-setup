ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways

Question 1: FAISS + JSON

FAISS = Fast vector search (numbers only)
JSON = Flexible metadata (text, paths)
Together = Best performance + flexibility

Question 2: Batch Size

Batch 16 = Safe, good for laptops
Batch 64 = 3x faster, needs 8GB+ RAM
Trade-off: Speed vs memory safety

Question 3: Temperature

Temp 0.2 = Factual, grounded in sources (RAG)
Temp 0.8 = Creative, but hallucinates
RAG needs consistency, not creativity

Question 4: 10GB Logs

Current approach: Works but slow (27 hours)
Optimizations needed:

Parallel processing (8x faster)
Smart sampling (10x smaller index)
Hierarchical indexing (20x faster search)
Incremental checkpoints (resume capability)
Intelligent filtering (focus on errors)
